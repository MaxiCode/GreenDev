This is the beta-1.0- release candidate 1
release of the Patty Java Performance Analyzer 
program.

This release includes:

* Fixed an issue where the stack trace used in
  collecting monitor contention information
  was incorrect. It was using the second stack
  frame while there is a possibility there is
  only one.
* Now always initializing the ClassInfo* 
  structure. I have seen cases where the 
  numbers are excessively high, possibly through 
  picking up uninitialized memory.
* Fixed deinstrumentation (did not work).
* No longer printing a stack trace on socket 
  disconnect in web application.

KNOWN ISSUES
============

I have decided not to include the test app
nor the dumper, until a better version
is available.
