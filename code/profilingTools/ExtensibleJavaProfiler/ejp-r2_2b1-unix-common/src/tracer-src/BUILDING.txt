This file contains instructions for building EJP-Tracer.

The following environments are supported and tested:
- ppc-darwin
- sparc-solaris
- x86-linux
- x86-solaris
- x86-win32-cygwin
- x86-win32-mingw

Porting to other platforms should be easy if GCC version 3.x (or more) is 
available.

Note that building on Win32 is in most cases not necessary, as EJP-Tracer
comes with a pre-built DLL in the lib/ directory.


Building
--------

* Ensure you have a correctly set JAVA_HOME variable. It should point to a
  directory containing an include/ subdirectory containing a jvmpi.h file.

* Change to the gen/ directory.

* For Darwin (MacOSX 2) only: edit ppc-darwin.mk to set your Java includes
  directory.

* Run make -f <environment>.mk 
  where <environment> is one of the supported environments listed above.
