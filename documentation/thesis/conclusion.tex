\centerline{\emph{Can we identify performance hot-spots in configurable software systems?}}

This is the main question of this thesis. We wanted to discover performance hot-spots in configurable software systems to push the classical \ac{SPE} approach to configurability-aware performance analysis at method level.

\section{Concluding Remarks}



Approach afgestellt

profiler verglichen




was haben wir erreicht:
1. Reduce measurement time of profiling by excluding at least 94 \% of the methods. Profiling need at least triples the time so we can achieve at least triple measuring speed.

If we do the dataflow analysis apart from the profiling process we can again speed up the measurement process by using Kieker or SPASSmeter. 2 times faster than.

Was hab ich also erreicht:
Visualisations:
Createing of proper visualisations


performance on method level mehr verstanden als vorher

\section{Outlook and Future Work}

Was könnte passieren damit?


nico fragen :)





Wa muss man dafür tun?

Focus on important parts (methods)
Use sampling
use other systems






GC.
gc analysis -> analysie sttdev if one methos (catena dbg) several times. with same settings. -> look at gc behaviour -> extract function and test function with differerent workloads (and if method is configuration dependent, try to trace conf option until method and contigure it ?)

but if he does always the same, we might not notice the problem

or mitloggen


2. higher order interactions. 
we only used pairs of interactions, so (course of high dim -> catena von 8 auf 55 options [calc the fuck 3 times thing])

also possible reason. we have higher order interactions. In depth knowledge about Catena from developer: Garlic is the main reason for time changes but example table \ref{tbl:unlearnable_methods_catena} shows the problem. Garlic increases, but performance of method goes down.

3. too less data. 4 graphs in catena ... only one is active. so 1000/4 = 250 measurements in which the graph is 


because catena is the smallest of the 3 subject systems we will focus our discussion to that. H2 and Sunflow does have roughly the same fraction of methods.
