%Abriss des Problems:
% Energy consumption of ICT (information and communication technology) sector.
% Is growing the most.
% Correlation to CO2 emissions
% Economy tries to save energy of hardware (with energy labels for example) but analysis about consumption of software approaches recently.
Energy consumption and energy efficiency are big challenges this time. Many areas like economy and politic discuss about it. Countries give themselves thresholds for greenhouse gas output. To achieve these goals they invest in green energy and publish guidelines.
